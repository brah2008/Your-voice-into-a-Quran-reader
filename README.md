# Your voice into a Quran reader
Turn your voice into a Quran reader It is used in mosques (a microphone that converts your voice into a Quran reader of your choice) as an amplifier

To create a **Python application** to turn your voice into a Quran reader, you can use **speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) technology**. Here are the general steps to do this:

**-** Record your voice input using speech recognition library such as SpeechRecognition.
**-** Convert the recorded speech to text using an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) engine.
**-** Once the speech is converted to text, use a TTS engine such as gTTS to convert the text to speech.
**-** Use the resulting audio to play back through a speaker or microphone.

It's important to note that building a high-quality, accurate and reliable voice-to-Quran reader would require extensive development and testing efforts, and access to high-quality speech data.
